# Image-Captions
This project uses the Flickr8k dataset to create image captions, with a ResNet18 encoder and LSTM decoder. The ResNet18 model extracts visual content, while the LSTM network generates captions word by word. The model's performance is evaluated by comparing predicted and ground truth captions.
